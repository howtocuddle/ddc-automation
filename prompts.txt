Convert this Dewey Decimal Schedule page (or pages) into JSON for a linked database.
Do not hallucinate. Use only visible text from the image(s). Preserve wording verbatim where practical.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY)
• Output ONLY a JSON ARRAY valid to the provided response_schema (no prose, no explanations, no code fences).
• Every object MUST include: id, type="Concept", notation, prefLabel.en, page, source.fileName.
• Maintain the top-to-bottom order of entries as they appear on the page.
• The page number must be taken from file instead of the page written in document.

ON-PAGE-ONLY RULE
• Emit ONLY concepts whose DDC notation is visibly printed on THIS page image (or images in this request).
• Do NOT infer siblings, parents, or children that are not printed on the page.

ID & NOTATION RULE
• For normal entries:
  - notation: use the printed DDC number with any internal spaces REMOVED (e.g., ".102 8" → ".1028"). Keep the leading dot if it is printed.
  - id: set to "Volume3-" + ABS_NOTATION_NO_SPACES.
      • If the printed notation is already absolute (e.g., "030.9"), id = "Volume3-030.9".
      • If the printed notation is relative (starts with a dot, e.g., ".102 8"), prepend the nearest visible 3-digit base notation on THIS page (e.g., "005") and then remove spaces: base "005" + ".102 8" → id "Volume3-005.1028".
      • If no base is visibly printed on THIS page, fall back to id = "Volume3-" + the (space-removed) printed notation (e.g., "Volume3-.1028").
• For sentinels: use id="__CONT__" (notation="__CONT__") or id="__PAGE__" (notation="__PAGE__").

ONE TOP-OF-PAGE RULE (APPLIES TO EACH PAGE)
Look at the very first printed content on THIS page:
A) If it starts with a fresh DDC heading/notation (notation matches ^\d{3}(?:\.\d+)* and a heading follows),
   → DO NOT emit any sentinel. Output the concepts for this page.
B) Otherwise (no fresh notation at the very top):
   Prepend EXACTLY ONE sentinel as the FIRST element for THIS page:
   • Continuation from previous page (starts mid-sentence):
     {
       "id":"__CONT__", "type":"Concept", "notation":"__CONT__",
       "prefLabel":{"en":""},
       "scope":{"notes":["<carry-over text from the very top of THIS page>"]},
       "page": <THIS_PAGE_NUMBER_FROM_FILE>,
       "source":{"fileName":"<THIS_IMAGE_FILE>","span":null}
     }
   • Page-level context (ANY non-DDC header/block before the first notation: e.g., SUMMARY, PREFACE, KEY TERMS, legends, captions, general notes):
     {
       "id":"__PAGE__", "type":"Concept", "notation":"__PAGE__",
       "prefLabel":{"en":"<header text if present, else 'PAGE_CONTEXT'>"},
       "scope":{"notes":["<verbatim lines from that contextual block>"]},
       "page": <THIS_PAGE_NUMBER_FROM_FILE>,
       "source":{"fileName":"<THIS_IMAGE_FILE>","span":null}
     }

HEURISTICS FOR DETECTING DDC HEADINGS
• Notations match: ^\d{3}(?:\.\d+)*  (e.g., 003, 004.36, 621.381.3).
• If the first line begins mid-sentence or no notation appears before body text, treat as continuation.
• If a heading bears a footnote/marker (*, †, ‡, etc.), copy its corresponding footnote text from the page into scope.notes[].

FIELD MAPPING (STRICT, ON-PAGE ONLY)
• notation: the printed DDC number with any internal spaces removed (e.g., ".102 8" → ".1028"). Keep the leading dot if it is printed.
• id: see “ID & NOTATION RULE” above (prefix "Volume3-" and no spaces/underscores).
• prefLabel.en: the printed heading line (verbatim).
• altLabel[]: variant names printed on the page for the same heading (if any).
• hierarchy.broader: set only if the parent notation is explicitly printed on this page; otherwise omit.
• hierarchy.narrower[]: child notations explicitly listed under this entry on this page.
• scope.classHere[]: “Class here …”
• scope.including[]: “Including …”
• scope.seeAlso[]: “See also …”
• scope.notes[]: other local notes; ALSO include any footnote text linked by heading markers.
• scope.standardSubdivisions: true only if explicitly indicated on this page (e.g., “Use notation 019 from Table 1 …” or an explicit “Standard subdivisions” line).
• scope.variantNameLabel[] / manualRefs[] / tableRefs[] / addToBaseRules[] / relocations[]: fill only if printed on this page.
• ranges[]: only visible spans; use { "from":"004.11", "to":"004.16", "label":"<nearby label if any>" }.
• examples[]: any explicit examples printed for that entry.
• page: THIS page number (integer).
• source.fileName: THIS image’s filename (exact).
• skos.inScheme: "DDC23". Set skos.topConceptOf ONLY if explicitly shown; otherwise omit.

• hierarchy: OMIT THIS FIELD ENTIRELY for all objects (we will compute broader/narrower programmatically later). 
  Do not output hierarchy, hierarchy.broader, or hierarchy.narrower.

ROUTING (STRICT)
• Lines beginning with these cues MUST be placed into the matching scope fields (not in notes):
  - “Class here …” → scope.classHere[]
  - “Including …” → scope.including[]
  - “See also …” or “For …, see …” → scope.seeAlso[]
  - “See Manual at …” → scope.manualRefs[]
  - Lines mentioning “Table 1” or “Use notation 019 from Table 1 …” → scope.tableRefs[] (also set scope.standardSubdivisions=true)
  - “Add to base …” → scope.addToBaseRules[]
  - “Relocated …” → scope.relocations[]
  - “Variant name: …” → scope.variantNameLabel[]
• Only keep residual lines in scope.notes[].

MINIMALISM
• Omit fields that would be empty arrays or empty objects. Do NOT emit nulls unless the schema demands it.

MULTI-PAGE CALLS
• Produce a SINGLE JSON ARRAY covering ALL attached pages.
• Apply the ONE TOP-OF-PAGE RULE independently per page.
• Each object MUST carry the correct page and source.fileName.

STRICTNESS
• If the top of the page is continuation or other non-DDC content and you omit the required sentinel, the output is invalid.
• Do NOT invent content not visible on the page image(s).
• Do not emit the "hierarchy" field at all (no broader/narrower in this pass).
