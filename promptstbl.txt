Extract Dewey Decimal **Tables** (T1–T6) from the provided page image(s) into JSON for a linked database (I have license).
Use only visible text from the image(s). Preserve wording verbatim where practical. Do not hallucinate.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY)
• Output ONLY a JSON ARRAY valid to the provided response_schema (no prose, no explanations, no code fences).
• Every object MUST include: id, type="Concept", notation, prefLabel.en, page, source.fileName.
• Maintain the top-to-bottom order of table rows as they appear on EACH page.
• The page value MUST come from the provided file context (not any printed folio on the page image).

ON-PAGE-ONLY RULE
• Emit ONLY rows whose table notation is visibly printed on THIS page image (or images in this request).
• Do NOT infer siblings, parents, or children that are not printed on the page.

TABLE & ROW TYPING
• Set table to one of: "T1","T2","T3A","T3B","T3C","T4","T5","T6".
  – Detect from the page header (e.g., “Table 1”), section title, or row labeling.
• Optionally set rowType:"TableRow" for clarity (not required by the schema).

ID & NOTATION RULE (TABLES)
• Do not use Brackets example: T1:-(016)→ T1:-016

• Normalize the printed table notation by removing internal spaces. Preserve leading hyphen(s) as printed.
  – Examples: "-093" stays "-093"; "--3" stays "--3"; "-1 2" → "-12".
• id = "<TABLE>:" + <NORMALIZED_NOTATION>
  – Examples: "T1:-093", "T3B:--3"
• prefLabel.en = the printed row heading/label text (verbatim).

ONE TOP-OF-PAGE RULE (APPLIES PER PAGE)
A) If the first printed content on THIS page begins with a fresh table row notation (matches TABLE HEADING DETECTION below), DO NOT emit any sentinel.
B) Otherwise, prepend EXACTLY ONE sentinel as the FIRST element for THIS page:
   • Continuation from previous page (begins mid-sentence/fragment of a row):
     {
       "id":"__CONT__", "type":"Concept", "notation":"__CONT__",
       "prefLabel":{"en":""},
       "scope":{"notes":["<carry-over text from the very top of THIS page>"]},
       "page": <THIS_PAGE_NUMBER_FROM_FILE>,
       "source":{"fileName":"<THIS_IMAGE_FILE>","span":null}
     }
   • Page-level context (ANY non-row header before the first row—e.g., TABLE header block, explanatory legends, captions, general notes):
     {
       "id":"__PAGE__", "type":"Concept", "notation":"__PAGE__",
       "prefLabel":{"en":"<header text if present, else 'PAGE_CONTEXT'>"},
       "scope":{"notes":["<verbatim lines from that contextual block>"]},
       "page": <THIS_PAGE_NUMBER_FROM_FILE>,
       "source":{"fileName":"<THIS_IMAGE_FILE>","span":null}
     }

TABLE HEADING DETECTION (ROWS)
• A table row begins with a table notation token, typically with leading hyphen(s): ^-+\s*\d+(?:\.\d+)*\b
  – Examples: "-093", "-1", "-12.3", "--3", "--09"
• If the first visible line begins mid-sentence or without a leading table notation, treat as continuation (__CONT__).
• If a row heading includes marker(s) (*, †, ‡, etc.), copy the associated footnote text into scope.notes[].

FIELD MAPPING (STRICT, ON-PAGE ONLY)
• notation: the printed table number token with internal spaces removed; keep the printed leading hyphen(s).
• id: "<TABLE>:" + notation (no spaces).
• table: the detected table code ("T1","T2","T3A","T3B","T3C","T4","T5","T6").
• rowType (optional): "TableRow".
• prefLabel.en: the printed row heading text (verbatim).
• altLabel[]: variant names printed for the same row (if any).
• scope.classHere[]: lines starting “Class here …”
• scope.including[]: lines starting “Including …”
• scope.seeAlso[]: “See also …” or patterns like “For …, see …”
• scope.manualRefs[]: lines starting “See Manual at …”
• scope.tableRefs[]: any line referring to other tables or table mechanics (e.g., “from Table 1 …”, “use with …”)
• scope.addToBaseRules[]: lines starting “Add to base …”, “Then add …”, or any explicit building instructions
• scope.relocations[]: lines mentioning relocation
• scope.variantNameLabel[]: “Variant name: …”
• scope.notes[]: only residual notes not covered above; include any footnote text linked by markers.
• ranges[]: use only for explicit printed row-span ranges; shape {"from":"-09","to":"-099","label":"<nearby label if any>"}.
• examples[]: any explicit examples printed for that row.
• page: THIS page number (integer) from the file context.
• source.fileName: THIS image’s filename (exact).
• skos.inScheme: "DDC23". Only include skos.topConceptOf if explicitly shown.

HIERARCHY OUTPUT
• Do NOT output the "hierarchy" field in this pass (broader/narrower are computed later).

ROUTING (STRICT)
• The cue phrases above MUST be routed into their matching scope arrays. Do not leave routed lines in scope.notes[].

MINIMALISM
• Omit fields that would be empty arrays or empty objects. Do NOT emit nulls unless the schema requires it.

MULTI-PAGE CALLS
• Return a SINGLE JSON ARRAY covering ALL attached pages; each object MUST carry its correct page and source.fileName.
• Apply the TOP-OF-PAGE sentinel rule independently per page.

STRICTNESS
• If the top of the page is continuation or other non-row content and you omit the required sentinel, the output is invalid.
• Do NOT invent content not visible on the page image(s).
